Use your creativity to create an application that only does authentication.

Requirements
Welcome Screen
Login Screen
Register Screen
You must use styled-components
You must choose a navigation library
You must choose a state library
You must create automated tests (feel free to decide what to use)
Make sure to use best practices when setting up your project. Things like eslint, prettier and editorconfig are well seen.

Plus
Work on the UI to make it look good
Make the authentication work with JWT (You can use Firebase or any public JSON API)
Animations
Semantic Git commits
Are you finished?
After you finish your test, upload the source code to Github in a private repository and contact your test applier.

Good luck!
